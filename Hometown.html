            <h2>About My Hometown</h2>
            <p>
             Afghanistan is a landlocked country located in Southern Asia that borders China,Iran,Pakistan,<br>
             Tajikistan,Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. The geography of Afghanistan is arid and mountainous;<br> 
             the Hindu Kush Mountains run northeast to southwest and divide the northern provinces<br>
             from the rest of the country.<br>
             The government system is an Islamic Republic; the chief of state and head of <br>
             government is the president.<br>
             Afghanistan has a controlled economic system in which the central government <br> 
             directs the economy regarding the production and distribution of goods.<br>
             Afghanistan is a member of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC).

        <h2>Culture</h2>

        <p>
        Afghan culture is very collectivistic and people generally put their family’s interests before their own.<br>
        This means that family responsibilities tend to hold a greater importance than personal needs.<br> 
        Loyalty to one’s family also generally supersedes any obligations to one’s tribe or ethnicity.<br>

        Throughout all of Afghanistan, family matters are kept strictly private. People are often <br>
        reluctant to share personal issues with non-family members as community knowledge of a <br>
        family’s struggles can bring shame on the household.

            <div class="highlight">
                <h3>Historical Landmark</h3>
                <p>
                    <h3>1.Minaret of Jam</h3>

                    If you visit Ghor province in Afghanistan, don’t forget to visit UNESCO World Heritage Site,<br>
                    the Minaret of Jam. Geographically, it lies in the Shahrak District, next to the Hari River.<br> 
                    It is believed that in the ancient times, the muezzin called for the prayer from this tower.<br>
                    The minaret walls are decorated with alternating bands of kufic and naskhi calligraphy, <br>
                    geometric patterns, and verses from the Quran. The circular minaret rests on an octagonal <br>
                    base with two wooden balconies and also had a lantern.<br>

                    

                    <h3>2.Kherqa Sharif</h3>

                    Located in Kandahar, Afghanistan is the holy Shrine of the Cloak. The shrine lies right next<br>
                    to the Kahandar mosque and one of the holiest sites in Islam. The building’s exteriors are <br>
                    of green marble from Lashkargah with tiled surfaces and beautiful gilded archways.The cloak<br>
                    is locked away inside the mosque and is rarely seen. Later the cloak was given to Amir Ahmad <br>
                    Shah Durrani in 1768 who is the founder of modern Afghanistan. Today, the site is a famous <br>
                    national landmark and attraction.

                    <h3>3.Gardens of Babur</h3>

                    One of the most gorgeous places to visit in Afghanistan is the Gardens of Babur in Kabul.<br>
                    The site is also the resting place of resting of the first of Mughal rulers,Zahir-ud-din<br>
                    Muhammad Babur. Developed in 1528, the garden truly flaunts the Mughal style of architecture.<br>
                    The grandeur of the Mughal style of art and way of living are not hidden from the world now<br>
                    and the garden is just another necessity for the former king. The garden has the tomb of <br>
                    Babur and also a mosque which was built for prayers.

                <h3>Natural Beauty</h3>

                <p>
                   Are you wondering about the beauty of Afghanistan ?<br>
                   Here are some of the most beautiful places in Afghanistan<br> 
                   These stunning locations and vistas will take your breath away in some of Asia’s most beautiful locations.<br>

                   Afghanistan, a land often overshadowed by its tumultuous history, hides within its borders a tapestry of<br> 
                   breathtaking landscapes and ancient wonders waiting to be explored. As the crossroads of many civilizations,<br> 
                   this nation boasts a rich tapestry of cultures, traditions, and stories that are as diverse as its topography.<br>

                   From the towering peaks of the Hindu Kush to the sprawling deserts of the south, Afghanistan is a treasure<br>
                   trove for the intrepid traveler. Its cities, steeped in history, tell tales of empires risen and fallen,<br>
                   of poets, warriors, and kings who once walked their streets.The allure of the most beautiful places in <br>
                   Afghanistan is not just in their visual splendor. But also in the stories they hold, the secrets they whisper,<br>
                   and the memories they’ve witnessed.<br>

                   <h3>1.Band-e Amir National Park</h3>
                   Amidst the rugged terrains of Afghanistan lies a gem that sparkles with nature’s splendor: Band-e Amir National Park.<br>
                   This natural wonder, with its series of six deep blue lakes, is a sight to behold and easily ranks among the prettiest
                   <br> places in Afghanistan.<br>

                   The park’s lakes are separated by natural dams made of travertine, a mineral deposit. <br>
                   The vibrant blue waters contrast beautifully with the arid, sun-baked landscapes surrounding them.<br>
                   Each lake has its own unique shade of blue, ranging from turquoise to deep azure, creating a mesmerizing<br>
                   visual spectacle.
                   <br>
                        


                   <h3>2.Bamiyan</h3>


                  In the heart of Afghanistan, Bamiyan stands as a testament to the country’s rich cultural and historical<br>
                  heritage. This region, with its serene landscapes and azure lakes, is undeniably one of the most <br>
                  beautiful places to visit in Afghanistan.<br>

                  The colossal Buddhas of Bamiyan, though now in ruins, once stood tall and proud, overlooking the valley.<br>
                  These ancient statues, carved directly into the cliffs, are a reminder of the Buddhist civilization that<br>
                  once flourished here. The surrounding caves, adorned with intricate frescoes, further showcase the <br>
                  artistic prowess of the bygone era.<br>

                          

                  <h3>4.Kabul</h3>


                 Kabul, the vibrant heart of Afghanistan, pulses with life and energy. As the capital city, it offers a unique<br>
                 blend of the old and the new. This makes it one of the places to see in Afghanistan that you simply can’t miss.<br>

                The city’s skyline is a testament to its rich history, with ancient fortresses standing alongside modern skyscrapers.<br>
                The Gardens of Babur, a serene oasis in the midst of urban hustle, offer a peaceful retreat with meticulously <br>
                manicured lawns and fragrant flower beds. Here, one can reflect on the legacy of the great Mughal emperor Babur,<br>

                <h3>Local Markets</h3>
                <p>
                    <h3>The Kabul Markets, Afghanistan</h3>

                    Plunging into this Gordian knot of overheated Kabul traffic, you know there will be no turning back. Problem is, there also seems little chance of going forward. Dusty and dented cars, riding low on their axles from too many passengers, lurch forward centimetres at a time. Boldness is required to slip through the brief chance openings that will put you deeper into this tangle of automobiles, trucks, buses, and vans. Sweating, enraged but impotent drivers glare from awkwardly close distances. This is the crossing of the Rubicon. It’s an awkward tango through traffic gridlock; the ultimate destination is a mirage through a shimmering wall of leaded gasoline fumes.

                    Home to roughly five million people, the mountain city of Kabul, Afghanistan’s 3,500-year-old capital, was, in ancient times, a centre of education, politics, and culture. Today, following three decades of war, a traumatized population is just beginning to embrace civil society once again, with girls and boys attending school, a working (if corrupt) government, and the reconstruction of razed infrastructure. Such efforts are taxed by the constant influx of rural refugees seeking safe haven from fundamentalist Taliban extremists, who continue to terrorize the countryside.

                   Kabul is also a city of expats; NGOs, the United Nations, and NATO and American forces have tried to rebuild and secure the nation since 2001, when the Taliban was ousted. Security needs have turned areas of Kabul into enclaves—embassies hide behind thick, high concrete walls, protected by snipers and guards cradling assault rifles. Such zones of safety have caused Kabul roadways—originally built for a population of 400,000—to be diverted like a dammed river, forcing traffic into a few remaining thoroughfares.

                   Pul-e Khishti Bazaar is Kabul’s main open-air market, where you’ll be enveloped by a cacophony of sight, scent, and sound. Until it was destroyed in the 1980s during the Soviet Union occupation, Pul-e Khishti Bazaar, in the Old City, was regarded as not only one of the most ancient but also one of the most beautiful outdoor markets in the world—a jewel of a tourist draw during Kabul’s pre-war era, a happier time of outdoor cafés, treed streets, short skirts, and abundant hashish.

                   In the Dari language, Pul-e means “bridge” and Khishti means “brick”, or “built by small bricks”. The nearby bridge spans the dried-up, garbage-strewn Kabul River, where Afghan men gather to smoke heroin, seeking fleeting escape from poverty and war. At the bazaar, slaughtered sheep and cattle hang upside down on heavy iron hooks. Off to the side, their skins lie in neat, folded squares beside decapitated heads. Internal organs—so vibrantly red they are almost neon—hang next to the carcasses that once cocooned them. One magnificent white ram with corkscrew horns, his crown of curls hennaed red, lies with spindly legs tucked underneath, oblivious to the blood miasma of his slaughtered brethren.

                   “We have good earth and soil in Afghanistan,” says Tokhy. “The land is so fertile because we have lots of sun and very good, sweet water.”

                   Afghans love meat. In times of plenty, the national diet consists largely of animal products: meat, milk, yogurt, and cheeses like gouda and mozzarella. Unlike Canadian livestock, there is no thick layer of white fat—these beasts are lean and sinewy from foraging for grass on steep, arid hills and mountainsides. One butchered animal stands out from the others. A breed of sheep called the Afghan Arabi can be picked out immediately, despite being stripped of its wooly hide. This “fat-rumped” sheep stores adipose tissue in two watermelon-sized balls in its back end. Barbecued, these globes are a delicacy. Efficient little ungulates, the Arabi also provides fine-quality wool used to make the world-famous Afghanistan rugs.
